# speech-gpt-transcriber
This project is a voice-based chatbot that uses speech recognition and EdgeGPT to generate responses. It allows users to speak to the chatbot using a microphone and listen to the chatbot’s responses using a speaker. The chatbot uses EdgeGPT, a powerful natural language generation model, to create engaging and creative responses based on the user’s input.
